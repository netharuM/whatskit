# whatskit

a toolkit for whatsapp including

- whatsapp status downloader
- auto trimmer
  - it automatically trims the video to 30 sec clips so you don't have to trim the video into multiple 30 second parts
  - this renders the video clips when sharing
  - make sure to clear the ```rendered cache``` by clicking the "clear rendered cache" button in the trimmer page
    - this button is hidden until videos are rendered
    - and this button disappears when you reopen the app
    - in that case pls go to settings and clear the cache
    - rendered video clips are saved in ```/storage/emulated/0/android/data/com.netharuM.whatskit/files/Trimmer/```
